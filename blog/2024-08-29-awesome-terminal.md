title: Making Your Terminal Awesome
tags: [dev, macOS, CLI, Node.js]
---

The tools we use as developers make us more effective (or at least hopefully faster) developers. So why not spend some time to make one of the most common dev tools much more useful? Here's a way to give any terminal app a personalized and awesome experience (fwiw I use [the default app](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) included with macOS). Features covered will be the following:

-   a super informative and customizable prompt
-   per-directory prompt customization
-   automatic switching of Node.js versions (easily extended to any run-time)
-   better auto complete and history
-   optional "command done" chime

<!-- truncate -->

I'll add, each main feature discussed below is independent of each other. Meaning, you can pick individual features to add to your terminal.

Also, I use [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) so this post will specifically cover how to implement these features within that shell.

## Homebrew

If you're on a Mac and you don't already have Homebrew, I recommend using it for installing packages on a Mac. It's always been great for me and it is widely supported. The following sections do not _require_ Homebrew, but some will be easier with it.

Installation instructions are here: https://brew.sh. Homebrew is also on GitHub: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew

## Informative and Personalized Prompt

Here's my customized terminal prompt, enabled through [Starship](https://starship.rs):

![my custom terminal prompt](/my-custom-terminal-prompt.png)

It has the following features:

-   first line
    -   date
    -   24 time
    -   exit code of the last command that ran (in magenta)
    -   how long it took for the last command to run (in yellow)
-   second line
    -   an icon indicating that sudo is currently active (in magenta) (this is hidden when sudo is not active)
    -   an Apple icon since I'm on my Mac
        -   I choose a different icon for each device, like a Raspberry for prompts on my Raspberry Pi.
        -   This icon won't be as useful to you if you only use a single device.
    -   current username and host
        -   This is likely only useful if you switch users and/or devices frequently.
    -   the device's local IP address
    -   the current repo's git branch (if in a git repo)
    -   if there are currently uncommitted changes in the repo (indicated by the asterisks `*`)
-   third line
    -   current directory
-   fourth line
    -   prompt entry symbol (`$`) which changes color based on whether the previous command failed (red) or succeeded (green)
    -   the cursor

Here's how to set this up:

1. Install Starship: https://github.com/starship/starship?tab=readme-ov-file#step-1-install-starship.
2. Optional: choose and install a "Nerd Font" so you can use icons in your terminal: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
3. Add `eval "$(starship init zsh)"` to your `~/.zshrc` file
4. Create the file `~/.config/starship.toml`

After that, you can read up on how to customize Starship to your liking here: https://starship.rs/config/. I've included my own custom config below, which results in a prompt that looks like my above screenshot.

### Per-dir Prompt Customization

This will allow you to automatically switch your Starship config per directory. For example, I switch the main prompt color when in my work's repos vs in my personal repos.

1. create a copy of your default Starship config (from `~/.config/starship.toml`) and customize it to your liking
2. move that new Starship config into the directory in which you want it to be used
3. add the following code to your `~/.zshrc` file:
    <details>

    <summary>Click to expand `.zshrc`</summary>

    This adds a `cd` hook which will try to find and switch to, if found, a custom `starship.toml` file.

    ```zsh
    autoload -U add-zsh-hook
    change-starship-config() {
        # extended globbing
        setopt extended_glob
        # find a starship.toml file in parent directories
        local starshipConfig="$((ls (../)#starship.toml(:a)) 2>/dev/null)"
        if [ -e "$starshipConfig" ]; then
            if [ "$STARSHIP_CONFIG" != "$starshipConfig" ]; then
                echo "Local starship.toml found: switching to it now."
                export STARSHIP_CONFIG="$starshipConfig"
            fi
        else
            unset STARSHIP_CONFIG
        fi
        unsetopt extended_glob
    }
    add-zsh-hook chpwd change-starship-config
    change-starship-config

    # Make sure that this line is _after_ the above code
    eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    ```

    </details>

Now Starship will automatically use the closest `starship.toml` in your current or parent directory! (Or default to your main config in `~/.config/starship.toml`.)

## Automatic Node.js Version

This will automatically switch your terminal's Node.js version based on each directory's configuration. This makes switching between personal projects on the bleeding edge (using the latest Node.js version) to more stable work projects (requiring LTS Node.js versions) a breeze.

1. make sure you have `nvm` installed: `nvm -v`
    - if not, installation instructions are included here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script
2. add a `.nvmrc` file that only contains the Node.js version to each repo that needs a custom Node.js version
    - example: `.nvmrc` file with _only_ the contents `22`
3. add the following code to your `~/.zshrc` file:
    <details>

    <summary>Click to expand `.zshrc`</summary>

    This adds a `cd` hook which will try to find an `.nvmrc` file and, if found, use nvm to switch to that Node.js version for the current shell session. This will also download the Node.js version if it is missing.

    ```zsh
    # these two lines are nvm init code which you may already have
    # they must be _above_ the code below
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

    # place this after nvm initialization!
    load-nvmrc() {
        local node_version="$(nvm version)"
        local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

        if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
            local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

            if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
                nvm install
            elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then
                nvm use
            fi
        elif [ "$node_version" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
            echo "Switching to default node version"
            nvm use default
        fi
    }
    add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
    load-nvmrc
    ```

    </details>

Now whenever you change directories, your terminal will automatically switch Node.js versions if necessary!

## Better auto-complete and history

Use Oh My Zsh to provide better autocompletion and command history. This is by far the most heavy-weight and time consuming part of this blog post. Oh My Zsh has tons of default configurations which drive me crazy and I had to disable, though I don't remember anymore what exactly I disabled ðŸ™ƒ.

Install Oh My Zsh here: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-installation

As for disabling parts of Oh My Zsh, I was able to find answers on how to disable each feature I disliked by searching for them online.

## Command Done Chime

Most people will probably find this incredibly annoying, but I find it very useful for long running processes (like running local tests that take 5-10 minutes).

On a Mac, simply add the following code to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
precmd() { ( play --no-show-progress --single-threaded -v 2 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff & ) }
```

There are many other sounds in `/System/Library/Sounds` to choose from, and of course you can download any sound you wish and use it here.
